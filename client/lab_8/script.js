    ## JS and HTML Injection
      There are a bunch of methods to inject text or HTML into a document using JS
      Mainly, they're considered "unsafe" because they can spoof a page pretty easily
      But they're useful for starting to understand how websites work
      the usual ones are element.innerText and element.innerHTML
      Here's an article on the differences if you want to know more:
      https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/textContent#differences_from_innertext
  
    ## What to do in this function
      - Accept a list of restaurant objects
      - using a .forEach method, inject a list element into your index.html for every element in the list
      - Display the name of that restaurant and what category of food it is
